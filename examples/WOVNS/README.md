[WOVNS][wovns] is a San Francisco based company that is a textile studio and technology platform, giving designers access to the means of textile production.
David M. Ellis has created a set of vanilla processing examples producing [WOVNS][wovns] compatible designs, see his work on [github][github] and this [tutorial][tutorial] that he has produced for [WOVNS][wovns]. Here we show how you can use the ruby language to achieve the same result, in much more elegant code (certainly if you are rubyist for loops are plain ugly).
