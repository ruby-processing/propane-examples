# propane-examples
Example Sketches for propane-2.1.0 see also [Example-Sketches][examples] for JRubyArt (many of with only need to be class wrapped to run with propane).

WIP to complete translation from JRubyArt to propane using [this conversion tool][conversion], and by replacing `Processing::Proxy` with `Propane::Proxy`, and unest some classes as required.

See how to install [java libraries here][contributed]
