# propane-examples
Example Sketches for propane-2.6.0+ features replacement of `$app` with `Propane.app`, and additional hemesh examples.
See also [Example-Sketches][examples] for JRubyArt (many of with only need to be class wrapped to run with propane).

WIP to complete translation from JRubyArt to propane using [this conversion tool][conversion], and by replacing `Processing::Proxy` with `Propane::Proxy`, and unnest some classes as required.

See how to install [java libraries here][contributed]

To auto-run many samples `cd` this directory and `rake` for others like pbox2d
`rake pbox2d` you get the idea (read the Rakefile). NB: not all samples get auto-run, and where appropriate you need to install required library or gem.
