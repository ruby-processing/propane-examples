# Operator Precedence
#
# If you don't explicitly state the order in which
# an expression is evaluated, they are evaluated based
# on the operator precedence. For example, in the statement
# "4+2*8", the 2 will first be multiplied by 8 and then the result will
# be added to 4. This is because the "*" has a higher precedence
# than the "+". To avoid ambiguity in reading the program,
# it is recommended that is statement is written as "4+(2*8)".
# The order of evaluation can be controlled through placement of
# parenthesis in the code. A table of operator precedence follows below.

# The highest precedence is at the top of the list and
# the lowest is at the bottom.
# Multiplicative: * / %
# Additive: + -
# Relational: < > <= >=
# Equality: == !=
# Logical AND: &&
# Logical OR: ||
# Assignment: = += -= *= /= %=
