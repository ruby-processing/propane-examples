# Conditions are like questions.
# They allow a program to decide to take one action if
# the answer to a question is true or to do another action
# if the answer to the question is false.
# The questions asked within a program are always logical
# or relational statements. For example, if the variable 'i' is
# "even" then draw short line, else draw a long one.
