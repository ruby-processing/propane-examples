# An array is a list of data. Each piece of data in an array
# is identified by an index number representing its position in
# the array. Arrays are zero based, which means that the first
# element in the array is [0], the second element is [1], and so on.
# In this example, an array named "coswave" is created using ruby
# map with the cosine values. This data is displayed three
# separate ways on the screen.
