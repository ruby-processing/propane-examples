# The createGraphics() function creates an object from the PGraphics class
# (PGraphics is the main graphics and rendering context for Processing).
# The beginDraw() method is necessary to prepare for drawing and endDraw() is
# necessary to finish. Use this class if you need to draw into an off-screen
# graphics buffer or to maintain two contexts with different properties.
