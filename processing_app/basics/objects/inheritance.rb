# Inheritance
#
# A class can be defined using another class as a foundation. In object-oriented
# programming terminology, one class can inherit fields and methods from another.
# An object that inherits from another is called a subclass, and the object it
# inherits from is called a superclass. A subclass extends the superclass.
# see also inheritance_two for the use of hash args and inheritance that
# avoids the inherited class call to super
