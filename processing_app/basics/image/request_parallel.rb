# Shows how to use the request_image() function.
# The request_image() function loads images on a separate thread so that
# the sketch does not freeze while they load.
# These images are small for a quick download, but try it with your own huge
# images to get the full effect.

# See how to pad a number string in ruby using 'rjust'
