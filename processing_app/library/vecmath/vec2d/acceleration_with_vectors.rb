# Acceleration with Vectors 
# by Daniel Shiffman.
# PVector was used in the original (instead of Vec2D)
# 
# Demonstration of the basics of motion with vector.
# A "Mover" object stores location, velocity, and acceleration as vectors
# The motion is controlled by affecting the acceleration (in this case 
# towards the mouse)
#
# For more examples of simulating motion and physics with vectors, see 
# Simulate/ForcesWithVectors, Simulate/GravitationalAttraction3D
