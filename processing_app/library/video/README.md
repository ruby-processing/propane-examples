### README
Remember you need to install processing video library this way:-

```bash
propane --install Video
```

To install other contributed libraries eg `minim` [see documentation][docs]

NB: `captureEvent` and `videoEvent` both need the `video_event` library to be loaded (to access poxy java reflection methods).
