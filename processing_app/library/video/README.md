###README

You will need to install the video library from processing.org (since it is no longer included in the vanilla processing distro), this is easiest done from the processing ide, see the [Dan Shiffman video][] on video capture.

NB: `captureEvent` and `videoEvent` both need the `video_event` library to be loaded (to access poxy java reflection methods).
