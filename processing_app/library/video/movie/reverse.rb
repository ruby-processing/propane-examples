# Reverse playback example.

# The Movie.speed method allows to change the playback speed.
# Use negative values for backwards playback. Note that not all
# video formats support backwards playback. This depends on the
# underlying gstreamer plugins used by gsvideo. For example, the
# theora codec does support backward playback, but not so the H264
# codec, at least in its current version.
