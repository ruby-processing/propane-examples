### Simplex Noise ###

Mainly inspired by Karsten Schmidt, Stefan Gustavson I created a `simplex_noise` library for propane (mainly in java) but tweeked the example to work in ruby. Read more from [Stefan Gustavson][simplex] who created the java code. Kudos to Karsten Schmidt for the test code (vanilla processing not ruby version)
