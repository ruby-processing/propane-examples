# Thread function example
# by Martin Prout (after a Dan Schiffman vanilla processing version).
#
# This example demonstrates how to use Thread.new to spawn
# a process that happens outside of the main animation thread.
#
# When Thread.new is called, the draw loop will continue while
# the code inside the block passed to the thread will operate
# in the background.
#
# For more about threads, see: http://wiki.processing.org/w/Threading
