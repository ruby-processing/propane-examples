### LiquidFunProcessing Examples

NB: the `wave_machine.rb` sketch also requires the `PixelFlow` library also by Thomas Diewald.

You should install the libraries to `~/.propane/libraries` here I have renamed library and folder from camel-case to snake-case, you just have to be consistent with your naming.
