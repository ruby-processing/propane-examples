# HE_Mesh

Is a 3D Geometry java library for processing by [Frederik Vanhoutte](http://www.wblut.com/) see http://www.wblut.com/he_mesh/ sketches in this folder are expected to work with version 5.1.2. The library has changed a lot over the years and not necessarily for the better (dependencies seem to be expanding exponentially, this cannot be a good thing, just look at the disaster that is ruby-on-rails). However Frederik Vanhoutte has developed some rather cool sketches, it's just that need a lot of imagination and persistence to create equally good ones using the library.
