### Grafica library ###

The grafica library (by jagracar aka Javier Graci√° Carpio) can be installed via the processing-3.x ide.

These examples have been lifted from the grafica library examples, however we use the ruby `csv` library rather the processing `loadTable` to load data. Further the examples have where possible been adapted to look like regular ruby.
