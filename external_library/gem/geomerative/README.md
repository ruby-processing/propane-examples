### Examples ###

The solid_type sketch is a variant of an Amon Owed sketch requires propane-2.0.7 (or latest github version).
Requires [geomerative.gem][gem] and hemesh library, see [guide to install vanilla processing libraries][guide] in propane. You need to do something similar for vanilla processing pdf library (I have copy installed for JRubyArt), there might be other ways to get it eg github, ie without requiring a full vanilla processing install.

NB: to load `ttf` also known as true type fonts you should us absolute path unless they are included in the data folder (then use `data_path` wrapper)
