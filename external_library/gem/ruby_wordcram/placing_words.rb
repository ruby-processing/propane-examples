    # How should the words be arranged on the screen?
    # Each word gets a "target" location. WordCram will
    # place it there, and nudge it around until it
    # doesn't overlap any other words, or until it
    # gives up. High-weighted words are placed first.
    #
    # Placing words can be a bit tricky. If you try to
    # place the words too closely, WordCram will spend
    # most of its time trying to place words where
    # there's no room. Making the words smaller can help
    # there. Also, most placers take the screen width &
    # height into account, so those can affect the
    # outcome.
