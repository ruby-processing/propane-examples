# How to make a wordcram that pops up extra information
# when you click on a word.
#
# Each frame, we want to draw the wordcram, and some info
# about the word that's been clicked on (or hovered over).
# Each frame, you need to clean up what the last frame drew.
#
# Since laying out a wordcram is expensive, and there's
# (currently) no way to quickly re-render a wordcram,
# we don't want to make the wordcram in draw().
# (Besides, each frame would probably come out different.)
# Instead, render the wordcram in the setup() method, and
# cache it as a PImage. Then, in draw(), render that image
# first, which will overlay the last frame's image.
